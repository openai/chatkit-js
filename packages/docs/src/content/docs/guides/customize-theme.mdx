Match your app's aesthetic by adjusting theme options. The same options are available in React (`useChatKit`) and the web component (`chatkit.setOptions`).

Visit https://chatkit.studio/playground to experiment with different theme options and copy the code.

For all theming options, see the [API reference](../api/openai/chatkit/type-aliases/themeoption/).

```jsx
const options: Partial<ChatKitOptions> = {
  theme: {
    colorScheme: "dark",
    color: {
      accent: {
        primary: "#2D8CFF",
        level: 2,
      },
    },
    radius: "round",
    density: "compact",
    typography: { fontFamily: "'Inter', sans-serif" },
  },
};
```
