title: Composer
description: Configure placeholder text, attachments, tools, model picker, and @-mentions.
---

Tune the composer to guide users and control inputs. Options work in both React (`useChatKit`) and the web component (`chatkit.setOptions`).

## Placeholder text

Set contextual guidance directly in the composer.

```jsx
const options: Partial<ChatKitOptions> = {
  composer: { placeholder: "Ask anything about your workspace…" },
};
```

## Attachments

Allow users to upload files and images. Set limits for size, count, and accepted types. For custom backends, also configure `api.uploadStrategy`.

```tsx
const options: Partial<ChatKitOptions> = {
  composer: {
    attachments: {
      enabled: true,
      maxSize: 20 * 1024 * 1024, // 20MB per file
      maxCount: 3,
      accept: { "application/pdf": [".pdf"], "image/*": [".png", ".jpg"] },
    },
  },
};
```

:::note[Note]
The following composer options are only available for integrations with a **custom backend** using the ChatKit Python SDK.
:::

## Tool menu

Offer composer tools that hint the model toward specific workflows.

```jsx
const options: Partial<ChatKitOptions> = {
  composer: {
    tools: [
      {
        id: "add-note",
        label: "Add Note",
        icon: "write",
        pinned: true,
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

## Model picker

Let users choose between allowed models before sending a message.

```jsx
const options: Partial<ChatKitOptions> = {
  composer: {
    models: [
      { id: 'gpt-5-nano', label: 'Fast' },
      { id: 'gpt-5', label: 'Best', default: true },
    ],
  },
};
```

## @-mentions for entities

Enable entity tagging with search and previews to keep responses grounded in your domain.

```jsx
const options: Partial<ChatKitOptions> = {
  entities: {
    onTagSearch: async (query: string) => [
      { id: "article_123", title: "The Future of AI", interactive: true },
    ],
    onRequestPreview: async (entity) => ({
      preview: {
        type: "Card",
        children: [
          { type: "Title", value: entity.title },
          { type: "Text", value: "Shows up when hovering tagged entities." },
        ],
      },
    }),
  },
};
```
