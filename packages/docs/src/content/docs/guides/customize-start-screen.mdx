Guide first-time users with a greeting and suggested prompts when a new thread is opened. The start screen prompt icon is a [ChatKitIcon](../api/openai/chatkit/type-aliases/chatkiticon).

```js
const options: Partial<ChatKitOptions> = {
  startScreen: {
    greeting: "What can I help you build today?",
    prompts: [
      {
        label: "Check a ticket status",
        prompt: "Can you help me check on the status of a ticket?",
        icon: "search",
      },
      {
        label: "Create a ticket",
        prompt: "Can you help me create a new support ticket?",
        icon: "write",
      },
    ],
  },
};
```
