ChatKit is customized by passing in options object. 

- In React options are passed to `useChatKit({...})`
- In a direct integration options are set with `chatkit.setOptions({...})`

In both cases the shape of the options object is the same. Below are some examples of how to customize ChatKit.

---



## Change the theme

Match your app’s aesthetic by switching between light and dark themes, setting an accent color, controlling the density, rounding of corners, etc.

For all theming options, see the [API reference](../api/openai/chatkit/type-aliases/themeoption/).


```jsx
const options: Partial<ChatKitOptions> = {
  theme: {
    colorScheme: "dark",
    color: { 
      accent: { 
        primary: "#2D8CFF", 
        level: 2 
      }
    },
    radius: "round", 
    density: "compact",
    typography: { fontFamily: "'Inter', sans-serif" },
  },
};
```


### Override text in the composer and start screen

Let users know what to ask or guide their first input by changing the composer’s placeholder text.

```jsx
const options: Partial<ChatKitOptions> = {
  composer: {
    placeholder: "Ask anything about your data…",
  },
  startScreen: {
    greeting: "Welcome to FeedbackBot!",
  },
};
```


## Show starter prompts for new threads

Guide users on what to ask or do by suggesting prompt ideas when starting a conversation.


```js
const options: Partial<ChatKitOptions> = {
  startScreen: {
    greeting: "What can I help you build today?",
    prompts: [
      { 
        name: "Check on the status of a ticket", 
        prompt: "Can you help me check on the status of a ticket?", 
        icon: "search"
      },
      { 
        name: "Create Ticket", 
        prompt: "Can you help me create a new support ticket?", 
        icon: "write"
      },
    ],
  },
};
```


### Add custom buttons to the header

Custom header buttons help you add navigation, context, or actions relevant to your integration.


```jsx
const options: Partial<ChatKitOptions> = {
  header: {
    leftAction: {
      icon: "settings-cog",
      onClick: () => openProfileSettings(),
    },
    rightAction: {
      icon: "home",
      onClick: () => openHomePage(),
    },
  },
};
```

### Enable file attachments

Attachments are disabled by default. To enable them, add attachments configuration. 
Unless you are doing a custom backend, you must use the `hosted` upload strategy. 
See the Python SDK docs for more information on other upload strategies work with a custom backend.

You can also control the number, size, and types of files that users can attach to messages.

```jsx
const options: Partial<ChatKitOptions> = {
  composer: {
    attachments: {
      uploadStrategy: { type: 'hosted' },
      maxSize: 20 * 1024 * 1024, // 20MB per file
      maxCount: 3,
      accept: { "application/pdf": [".pdf"], "image/*": [".png", ".jpg"] },
    },
  },
}
```

## Add custom tools to the composer

Enhance productivity by letting users trigger app-specific actions from the composer bar. The selected tool 
will be sent to the model as a tool preference. 

Link to docs on tools.

```jsx
const options: Partial<ChatKitOptions> = {
  composer: {
    tools: [
      {
        id: 'add-note',
        label: 'Add Note',
        icon: 'write',
        pinned: true,
      },
    ],
  },
};
```


## Toggle UI regions/features

Disable major UI regions / features. 

- Disabling the header can be useful when you need more customization over the options that are available in the header and want to implement your own.
- Disabling history can be useful when the concept of threads/history doesn't make sense for your use case, e.g. a support chatbot.

```jsx
const options: Partial<ChatKitOptions> = {
  history: { enabled: false },
  header: { enabled: false },
};
```


## Override the locale

Override the default locale e.g. if you have an app-wide language setting. By default the locale is set to the browser's locale.

```jsx
const options: Partial<ChatKitOptions> = {
  locale: 'de-DE',
};
```
