title: Provide domain keys
description: Register your backend domains and pass the issued domain key to ChatKit.

Visit https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/security/domain-allowlist to register every hostname that loads ChatKit.js. The ChatKit iframe verifies the domain key by calling 

## Hosted backend

If you're using the hosted backend, the domain key will be encoded as part of the ChatKit session client secret and you don't need to pass it in your ChatKit options.

## Custom backend

For custom backends use the issued `domainKey` in your ChatKit options like the following example:

```ts
const options = {
  api: {
    url: "https://your-domain.com/chatkit/api",
    // Copy this value from the domain allowlist entry.
    domainKey: "your-domain-key",
  },
};
```

The ChatKit iframe will make an outbound request to https://api.openai.com to verify the domain key on load.
